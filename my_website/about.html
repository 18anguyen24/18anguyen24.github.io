    <p> My name is Andrew Nguyen.  I have been watching and experiencing Pokemon since 1st grade.  My first Pokemon game I came into contact with would most likely be Pokemon
     Emerald.  I never actually got to play it, instead I watched my cousin play it.  Inspired by it, I got my first DS and Pokemon game called Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
     Explorers of Time.   I was very fascinated by it, and eventually got my first main series game known as Pokemon Platinum in the 6th grade.  Since playing it,
     I've asked my parents to help me with my Pokemon journey, and eventually I was able to play all Pokemon games to date.  In all, I'm very addicted
     to Pokemon and will continue to play until the day I die!</p>
