    <p class="kek"> My name is Andrew Nguyen.  I have been watching and experiencing Pokémon since 1st grade, now in the 11th.  My first Pokémon game I came into contact with would most likely be Pokemon
     Emerald.  I never actually got to play it, instead I watched my cousin play it.  Inspired by it, I got my first DS and Pokemon game called Pokémon Mystery Dungeon
     Explorers of Time.   I was very fascinated by it, and eventually got my first main series game known as Pokémon Platinum in the 6th grade.  Since playing it,
     I've asked my parents to help me with my Pokémon journey, and eventually I was able to play all Pokémon games to date.  In all I really love Pokémon of all generations and I hope to continue 
     playing it for the rest of my life!</p>
